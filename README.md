## Background
Programming has been my hobby for over a decade. My journey began in high school, but it truly took off after my first Numerical Analysis class, where I witnessed first hand the endless posibilities of computing and the deep understanding it entails.

Throughout my university years, I spent most of my free time doing multiple courses. One of my favorites was "Build 10 Real-World program", a course for python in Udemy that keeps getting updated every once in a while! (highly recommended). To name a few other courses: 
- +100 hours of Java courses.
- CoderHouse's front-end and back-end courses.
- Multiple courses from FreeCodeCamp, from their mainpage and their Youtube channel.
- Many practical projects throughout the internet, mainly from Youtube or challenges from forums that seemed interesting.

If you're wondering why I don't have more repositories up, it’s because I never imagined I would work in this field; it was always a hobby for me. Therefore, I never uploaded my personal projects. Currently, I’m focusing on creating new and more advanced projects that reflect my growth.

<s> I plan to eventually upload my thesis, which is a multi-physics problem solver based on FEM programmed in C++, once I get the perms to publish the code from my University.</s> (didn't get them, my university asked to keep the code and keep working on it)

## Things I have worked with:
- C++, Java, Fortran, Python, Javascript, PHP
- React and Vue
- Node, Next.js, Laravel
- Facebook and Google's APIs
