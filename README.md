- 👋 Hi, I’m Tomás Liñan. I'm a aeronautical engineer from Argentina that enjoys programming and learning new things :)
- 👀 I’m interested whatever that can catch my attention! I always have time to learn something new.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and practicing new python libraries, and my React skills as this is the last technology I have learned
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that seems intresting and that can help me learn new things.

-I have been programming for many years at this point. I have done many courses like "build 10 Real-World program" for python, +100hours courses for Java, CoderHouse front-end courses, FreeCodeCamp courses (from their mainpage and their Youtube channel), many practical projects throughout the internet (mainly from Youtube or challenges from forums that seemed interesting). After saying all that, you may be thinking that I don't have that many projects ... but that's because I'm dumb, and never bothered uploading them because I always thought of them as personal practices or personal projects that would only be of interest for me. Now is kinda hard to go and check 5 years old code, that I don't remember that much about, and decide if it's worth for a place in my Github or not. At this point I decided to just make new and more advanced projects with my new knowledge (even thought that means I don't have that many at the moment).

On another point, I will upload my thesis (which is a multi-physics problem solver based on FEM and programmed on C++) once I get the perms to publish the code from my University.
