- 👋 Hi, I’m Tomás Liñan or as my username says @Tomas-Li (at least for github). I'm an mechanical aeronautical engineer from Argentina that enjoys programming and solving problems :)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things! I always have time to learn something new that seems interesting (and being honest, is actually really easy to catch my interest LOL)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and practicing new python libraries that can help me automatize (or at least ease) things that I usually do
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that seems intresting and that can help me learn new things.
